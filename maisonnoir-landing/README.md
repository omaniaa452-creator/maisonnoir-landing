# MaisonNoir Landing (single-file)

This repo contains your landing page as a single `index.html` file.

## Run
Just open `index.html` in your browser.

## Notes
- This version uses Tailwind CDN (as in your original file).
- Images are still remote URLs (as in your original file).

If you want, I can generate a Vite + Tailwind project structure and move scripts/styles/images into organized folders.
